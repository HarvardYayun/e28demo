    <h1>DGMD E-28 Week 0 Assignment</h1>
    
    <p>Hi, my name is Yayun Wang. I go by Stella.</p>
    <p>I grew up in China and moved to the States in my 20s. I currently live in San Diego.</p>
    <p>I graduated from UC San Diego, majoring in Visual Arts - Media.</p>
    <p>I have made several short films and tons of photography works in the past, I have also been working as a UI/UX web designer.</p>
    <p>I have some web development experience as a web designer. I built my portfolio using Webflow and also use it daily for work.</p>
    <p>I can manage web-building software like WordPress, Wix, and others, but I lack manual coding experience.</p>
    <p>Although we can rely on web-building software nowadays, I hope to gain a strong understanding of the foundation of HTML, especially JavaScript.</p>
    <p>Besides this, my second goal for this class is to learn how to debug issues, which requires mastering the first goal.</p>
